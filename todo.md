# Rust Programming Learning Plan

## 1. Plan Overview

- **Goal:** To finish reading 'The Rust Programming Language' and systematically learn Rust's core concepts to complete the final project (a multithreaded web server).
- **Learning Method:**
    1. **Preparation (YouTube):** Quickly watch YouTube lectures on the topic to get an outline of the concepts.
    2. **Main Study (The Book):** Carefully read 'The Rust Programming Language' and run the example code yourself.
    3. **Review (Note-taking):** Internalize the knowledge by summarizing what you've learned in your own words.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** Approx. 4 weeks (26 days)
- **Daily Study Time:** 3 to 5 hours
