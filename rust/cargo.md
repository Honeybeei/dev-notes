## 👀 Fast Lookup

- **Cargo** is Rust's package manager and build system.
- Use `cargo check` to quickly check for errors without building an executable.
- Use `cargo build` to compile the project in debug mode, or `cargo build --release` for an optimized release build.

## ❓ What is Cargo?

Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It simplifies the process of managing Rust projects, including dependencies, building, testing, and packaging.

## 🚀 Featured Commands

- `cargo --version`: Displays the version of Cargo installed.

- `cargo new <project_name>`: Creates a new Rust project with the specified name.

- `cargo check`: Checks the current project for errors without producing an executable.
  - This is faster than `cargo build` because it skips the linking step.
  - Use `cargo check` mainly and use `cargo build` only when you need the executable.

- `cargo build`: Compiles the current project.
  - By default, it builds in debug mode, which is optimized for fast compilation. It creates an executable in the `target/debug` directory.
  - Use `cargo build --release` for a release build, which is optimized for performance. Executables will be placed in the `target/release` directory.

- `cargo run`: Runs the current project.

- `cargo test`: Runs the tests for the current project.

- `cargo doc --open`: Generates documentation for the current project and opens it in a web browser.

## 📄 Cargo Related Files and Keywords

### 📝 `Cargo.toml`

The manifest file for Rust projects, containing metadata and dependencies.

- `[package]`: Section header for package metadata.
  - `name`: The name of the package.
  - `version`: The version of the package.
  - `authors`: The authors of the package.
  - `edition`: The edition of Rust used by the package.
- `[dependencies]`: Section for specifying dependencies. In Rust, packages are called "crates".

### 🔒 `Cargo.lock`

The lock file that records the exact versions of dependencies used in the project. It ensures reproducible builds by locking down the versions of all dependencies.

- Automatically generated by Cargo when dependencies are added or updated. (`build` command)
- Should not be manually edited.
